# Timezone-Project
This is my first full stack project





# Time Zone Clock Application  

A **React + Vite** application designed for managing and displaying customizable clocks with user-defined time zones and offsets. It offers a modular architecture, real-time updates, and a user-friendly interface for time zone operations.

---

## Features  

- **Local and Global Clocks**: Displays both the local clock and customizable clocks for other time zones.  
- **Add/Edit/Delete Clocks**: Create new clocks, edit existing ones, or remove them.  
- **Dynamic Time Difference**: Shows the difference between local and target time zones.  
- **Real-Time Updates**: Automatically updates the clocks in real-time.  
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Designed with reusable React components for maintainability.  
- **Modern Tooling**: Built with Vite for fast development and hot module replacement (HMR).

### Key Components  

1. **ClockDisplay**:  
   - Displays individual clock details like title, time, timezone, and time difference.  
   - Provides delete functionality with a dynamic UI to mark deleted clocks.  

2. **ClockForm**:  
   - Allows users to create or edit clocks.  
   - Supports timezone and offset adjustments dynamically.  

3. **ClockActions**:  
   - Handles clock management actions: Create, Edit, and Delete.  
   - Maintains the state for action mode (create/edit) and clock list.  

4. **LocalClock**:  
   - Displays the local clock information, showcasing the current time, title, and timezone.  

5. **useClock Hook**:  
   - Manages clock creation and calculates time differences dynamically.  

6. **Constants**:  
   - Contains predefined time zones and their offsets for global accessibility.

### Scripts  

- `yarn dev`: Start the development server with hot reloading.  
- `yarn build`: Build the app for production.  
- `yarn lint`: Run ESLint checks to ensure code quality.  
- `yarn preview`: Preview the production build locally.  

---

### Technologies Used  

- **React**: For building user interfaces.  
- **Vite**: Modern development environment for fast builds.  
- **date-fns**: For managing date and time calculations.  
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped and reusable styles for components.  

---

### Future Enhancements  

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Enable users to reorder clocks dynamically.  
- **Timezone Database Integration**: Add support for dynamic timezone data fetching from APIs.  
- **Notifications**: Set alarms or reminders for specific time zones.  
- **Persistent Storage**: Save clock data in local storage or a database.
